# Inversion and Optimisation Notes

This repo contains personal notes for the Optimisation and Inversion Module at Imperial College London.

## Contents

1. [SVD & Generalized Inverse](./chapters/svd.md):
    - main properties of eigenvalues decompositions, in particular for symmetric real matrices (real eigenvalues and orthogonal/orthonormal basis of eigenvectors)
    - the Singular Value Decomposition
    - the generalized inverse (or pseudo inverse, or Moore-Penrose inverse)
    - the problem of ill-conditioning, noise, and the role of regularisation in inverse problems
